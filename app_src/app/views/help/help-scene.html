			Why this app? The Dutch National Railways (NS) has begun to introduce free internet in their trains.
			A customer should connect to the TMOBILE WiFi network after which an introduction page should be shown.
			For webOS devices this introduction page is not shown, hence this app comes to the rescue.

			Just connect to the hotspot as usual.
			Your device will notify that a captive portal has been detected.
			This notification can be ignored.
			Instead open this app, wait a few moments for the gateway IP address(es) to appear, and press the green button.
			If all is well you will be taken to the introduction page where you can proceed as usual.

			When you experience difficulties it may be that your normal 3G gateway IP address was selected instead.
			Manually select another address by tapping the gateway IP address field (a list will appear) and try again.
			It may help to put your device in Aeroplane mode first to avoid such issues (your phone network connection will be turned off as well as the 3G connection).
			When connected, disable Aeroplane mode to restore a working phone connection.
